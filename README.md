I use pathogen to Manage my `'runtimepath'` with ease and Vundle to management my vim plugins. 

You can refer to this link for more information: [Pathogen]( https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen  )
and [Vundle]( https://github.com/gmarik/vundle  )

# Preparation:
if you don't have vim, choose one between vim-gnome and vim-gtk. For example:
	
	sudo apt-get install vim-gnome

If you have used the vim.

	mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_old
	mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_old

# Install with:
